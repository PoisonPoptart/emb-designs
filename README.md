# emb-designs
a repo of my collection for backup and organization (tired of windows copying instead of moving files).
files not intended for sale.<br/>
folder names are alphabetically reordered versions of the file source.<br/>
mainly vp3 files, but have most other versions as well in case i get a new embroidery machine soon.<br/>
note to self: use the green "code" button to download everything as a zip file and keep the organization.<br/>

* reminder: upload DST, PES, HUS, XXX, ART, EXP, JEF, VIP, BMC, COL, EMD, etc versions eventually
