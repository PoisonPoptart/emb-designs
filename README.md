# emb-designs
a repo of my collection for backup and organization (tired of windows copying instead of moving files).
files not intended for sale.
folder names are alphabetically reordered versions of the file source.
mainly vp3 files, but have most other versions as well in case i get a new embroidery machine soon.
note to self: use the green "code" button to download everything as a zip file and keep the organization.

* reminder: upload DST, PES, HUS, XXX, ART, EXP, JEF, VIP, BMC, COL, EMD, etc versions eventually
