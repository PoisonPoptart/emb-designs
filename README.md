# emb-designs
🗂️ a repo of my collection for backup and organization (tired of windows copying instead of moving files).
🛑⛔🚫files not intended for sale.<br/>
🧩 folder names are alphabetically reordered versions of the file source.<br/>
mainly vp3 files, but have most other versions as well in case i get a new embroidery machine soon.<br/>
💞️note to self: use the green "code" button to download everything as a zip file and keep the organization.<br/>

* 🌱 reminder: upload ART, BMC, COL, DST, EMD, EXP, HUS, JEF, PCS, PES, SEW, SHV, TBF, VIP, XXX etc versions eventually

📫 if anyone would like to help me collect the missing designs from my collection, please let me know <3<br/>
🔍 there used to be more "collection" sets from all these places, many don't exist anymore unless you can find a physical copy somewhere :(<br/>
😱 there was a bunch of FSL stuff a few years ago that now the shop links give an error. 🧩 "DEOS" and "aIinprs" (unscrambled) had some great ones that they've since taken down.
