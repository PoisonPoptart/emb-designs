# emb-designs
a repo of my collection for backup and organization (tired of windows copying instead of moving files).
files not intended for sale.<br/>
folder names are alphabetically reordered versions of the file source.<br/>
mainly vp3 files, but have most other versions as well in case i get a new embroidery machine soon.<br/>
note to self: use the green "code" button to download everything as a zip file and keep the organization.<br/>

* reminder: upload ART, BMC, COL, DST, EMD, EXP, HUS, JEF, PCS, PES, SEW, SHV, TBF, VIP, XXX etc versions eventually
